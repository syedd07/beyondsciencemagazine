                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="Abinayah John, researcher at Cambridge University and passionate rower" /></span>
                    <p>
                        At 5 AM, while the city is still wrapped in sleep, Abinayah John’s day begins. She brews her coffee and heads out to the river for a rowing session. “Surprisingly, I never used to consider myself a morning person, but now it has become an integral part
                        of my daily routine,” she shares. The exercise sets a positive tone, preparing her for the demanding day ahead.

                            <h4>From the Stage to the Lab</h4>
                            <p>
                                Abinayah’s journey to her laboratory involves a brisk bike ride. At Cambridge University, her research focuses on the electrical properties of cells in the nervous system, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders like Rett syndrome
                                and neurodegenerative diseases such as motor neurone disease (ALS). Her work is centered on interneurons, neurons that inhibit neural activity, and how mutations in genes like MECP2 and FUS affect these cells.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Her lab routine is precise and meticulous. She prepares artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and dissects brain slices, allowing them to incubate before recording neuronal activity. “It’s akin to eavesdropping on their intricate conversations and endeavouring
                        to decipher their functions,” she explains. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, she gathers data on how gene mutations impact neuronal function, aiming to uncover potential therapeutic targets.
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside the lab, Abinayah’s passion for rowing has been transformative. She began rowing in 2021, and the sport has helped her establish a disciplined routine and maintain her physical and mental well-being. “Rowing has played a vital
                        role in maintaining my physical and mental well-being and fostering connections with friends,” she notes.
                    </p>

                            <h4>Advocating for Equity in Science</h4>
                            <p>
                                In addition to her research and rowing, Abinayah is an advocate for science communication. As the Social Media Coordinator for Women in Neuroscience UK (WiNUK), she promotes equity in the field and engages a broader audience with her blog and social media
                                accounts. Through these platforms, she shares her PhD journey, highlights her research, and explores various neuroscience topics. Her goal is to make science accessible and engaging, emphasizing the importance of effective
                                communication.
                            </p>
                            <p>Abinayah’s dedication extends beyond her research. Her advice to aspiring researchers is to embrace failure as an integral part of the scientific process. “A significant lesson I’ve learned is separating my self-worth from
                                my research. Your worth as an individual is not determined by your failures,” she emphasizes. She believes in the importance of perseverance, curiosity, and a willingness to learn.

                            <h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
                            <p>
                                Abinayah John’s multifaceted approach to life and research is really notable. Whether she’s rowing at dawn, conducting intricate experiments, or advocating for women in science, her commitment to making a difference is evident in all she does.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As she looks ahead, Abinayah is excited about the future. She hopes to continue her research and contribute to the field of neuroscience. “I’m passionate about understanding the brain and how it functions,” she says. “I hope to make a meaningful impact
                                through my work and inspire others to pursue their passions.”
